# ☕ JavaProblems — Because Coffee and Bugs Go Together

> *"Java: Write once, debug everywhere."* — every Java developer, ever.

Welcome to **JavaProblems** — a curated collection of Java coding exercises designed to sharpen your problem-solving skills, one `NullPointerException` at a time. Whether you're a wide-eyed beginner or a seasoned developer who still Googles how to reverse a string, you're in the right place.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This repo contains hands-on Java problems covering fundamental programming concepts, including:

- ⭐ **Pattern Printing** — pyramids, triangles, and other shapes your compiler never asked for
- 🔁 **Loops & Conditionals** — because `while (true)` is a perfectly valid life strategy
- 🧮 **Algorithms & Logic** — train your brain before Stack Overflow does it for you

### 📁 Project Structure

```
src/main/java/com/studentassignone/studentassignone/
├── StudentAssignOne.java   — Entry point / main class
├── PyramidStar.java        — Star pyramid patterns
└── TriangleCharacter.java  — Character triangle patterns
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo** (yes, you actually have to do this part yourself):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MUGWANEZAMANZI/JavaProblems.git
   cd JavaProblems
   ```

2. **Open a problem file** under:
   ```
   src/main/java/com/studentassignone/studentassignone/
   ```

3. **Refactor the package name** if your IDE complains about it (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse may flag the package declaration when the project is imported outside its original directory structure). Simply update the `package` statement at the top of each file to match your local project name, or remove it entirely for quick local runs. AI can help you with that — but you *are* expected to understand why. No shortcuts!

4. **Run it** with Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn compile exec:java
   ```

## 💡 Prerequisites

- Java 17+ (or 25, if you're living in the future)
- Maven 3.x
- A willingness to stare at curly braces and feel something

## ❤️ A Love Letter to Java

Java gets a bad rap. It's verbose, it's strict, and it'll throw a `ClassCastException` at you with zero remorse.
But deep down, Java is reliable, powerful, and everywhere — from your bank's backend to your smart TV.

**Love Java. Fear Java. Respect Java.**

*Happy coding! May your builds be green and your logs be short.* 🍵
